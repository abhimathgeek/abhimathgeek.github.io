Greetings! My name is Abhishek, and I will be starting my PhD in mathematics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Before this, I completed my undergraduate studies in artificial intelligence at IIITD.

In the past, I have mostly worked with problems based on the distribution of arithmetic functions. I am learning about the bounded gaps between primes and other applications of sieve theory. While at IIIT Delhi, I studied the basics of analytic number theory under Dr. [Sneha Chaubey](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/sneha). I worked with Dr. [Anup Dixit](https://www.imsc.res.in/~anupdixit/), Dr. [Carlo Sanna](https://sites.google.com/view/carlo-sanna-math), Dr. [Subhajit Ghosechowdhury](https://iiitd.irins.org/profile/331110), and Dr. [Satish Kumar Pandey](http://noncommutative.space/) in various academic roles. In addition to mathematics, I enjoy watching anime (with Meitantei Conan being my favorite) and conversations with friends. Back in high school, I used to participate in math competitions and solve many problems on [AoPS](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/388865). Here is a link to my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d2LWJ3342Cco_QuRnZzPX63-DINzfoOJ/view?usp=sharing). My friends helped me reach my current position, specifically, my friend and mentor [Ayan](https://www.cmi.ac.in/~ayannath/).
