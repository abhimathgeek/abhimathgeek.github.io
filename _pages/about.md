Hi! I am Abhishek, currently an AI major. I have a keen interest in number theory and plan to pursue studies in mathematics. 

In the past, I have mostly worked with problems based on the distribution of arithmetic functions. Currently, I am learning about the bounded gaps between primes and other applications of sieve theory. At IIIT Delhi, I studied the basics of analytic number theory under Dr. [Sneha Chaubey](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/sneha). I have also worked with Dr. [Anup Dixit](https://www.imsc.res.in/~anupdixit/) and Dr. [Carlo Sanna](https://sites.google.com/view/carlo-sanna-math). Other than math, I like watching anime ([Meitantei Conan](https://www.detectiveconanworld.com/wiki/Main_Page) is my favorite!) and spending time with my sister. Back in high school, I used to participate in math competitions and solve a lot of problems on [AoPS](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community). Here is a link to my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d2LWJ3342Cco_QuRnZzPX63-DINzfoOJ/view?usp=sharing).
