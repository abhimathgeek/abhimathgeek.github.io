Greetings! My name is Abhishek, and I am a graduate student in Mathematics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign starting from Fall 2024. Previously, I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence from the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, New Delhi.

My research interests lie in analytic number theory, focusing on multiplicative number theory, sieve methods, statistics of primes and distribution of arithmetic functions. While at IIIT Delhi, I studied the basics of analytic number theory under Dr. [Sneha Chaubey](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/sneha). I worked with Dr. [Anup Dixit](https://www.imsc.res.in/~anupdixit/), Dr. [Carlo Sanna](https://sites.google.com/view/carlo-sanna-math), Dr. [Subhajit Ghosechowdhury](https://iiitd.irins.org/profile/331110), and Dr. [Satish Kumar Pandey](http://noncommutative.space/) in various academic roles. Back in high school, I used to participate in math competitions and solve many problems on [AoPS](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/388865). Here is a link to my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d2LWJ3342Cco_QuRnZzPX63-DINzfoOJ/view?usp=sharing). In the past, I have collaborated a lot with my friend and mentor [Ayan](https://ayan7744.github.io/).
