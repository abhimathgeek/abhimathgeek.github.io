Hi! I am Abhishek, currently an AI major. I have a keen interest in number theory and plan to pursue studies in Mathematics. 

In past, I have mostly worked with problems based on distribution of arithmetic functions. Currently, I am learning about the bounded gaps between primes and other applications of sieve theory. At IIIT Delhi, I have studied basics of analytic number theory under Dr. [Sneha Chaubey](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/sneha). I have also worked with Dr. [Anup Dixit](https://www.imsc.res.in/~anupdixit/) and Dr. [Carlo Sanna](https://sites.google.com/view/carlo-sanna-math). Other than math, I like watching anime ([Meitantei Conan](https://www.detectiveconanworld.com/wiki/Main_Page) is my favourite!) and passing time with my sister. Here is a link to my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d2LWJ3342Cco_QuRnZzPX63-DINzfoOJ/view?usp=sharing).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
