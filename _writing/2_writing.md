title: "p-adic Number Theory"
description: "I studied chapters 1, 2, and 4 from Neal Koblitz’s “p‐adic Numbers, p‐adic Analysis and Zeta functions”. I read the following papers
as part of the project: “The derivative of p‐adic Dirichlet series at s=0” [Stark’s Conjectures: Recent Work and New Directions,
(2004)] and “On the p‐adic series involving the infinite sum n^{k}. n!  [CRM Lecture Notes, 2004]. I could generalize the results of the second paper for
arithmetic progressions."
